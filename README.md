### Project Overview
> “Regular exercise is a requirement for good health but many of us need help to keep motivated. This app manages a monthly exercise challenge. For example, a run month where participants register to commit to running a minimum of 1 mile each day or a squat challenge in which the number of squats increases each day for the month.”
