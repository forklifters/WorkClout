> What did each member work on, what was accomplished, what worked during this iteration, what issues you encountered, how might you need to modify your goals for Sprint 2.

### Benjamin Napier

I completed UI for Login/Registration, attached our logo to the app so that it shows on the phone home screen, managed documentation for the team, helped teammates with Github issues, fixed my own issues with my AVD, and created tests for several different aspects of the app. 
During this sprint I had to spend a lot of time doing documentation related tasks and trying to fix my AVD. 
I now have an AVD that works so that I can test code that I write so that will not be an issue in the future. 
In future sprints I think I will change how I manage documentation a little bit by forgoing the transferring of team SCRUM meeting responses from an easy to write in Google sheet and having the team all write directly into the Markdown on the issues tab of our repo. 
Our team started off slowly this sprint but had a really strong increase of pace at the end of the sprint. 
Figuring out how to start next sprint with a stronger pace and keep pace rather than alter our speed halfway through will be important.

### Brian Zhang

I wrote the registration page to begin with but did not include implementation with firebase. 
Afterwards, I looked more into connecting the firebase database with the authenticator. 
I then wrote some error handling for the login and registration. I worked on the user stories completion and testing.

### Nathan Lieu

I attempted to make the login, help on the registration, and set up profile using firebase for the code. 
I also created the first basic UI for these pages too. 
Our group developed the database in firebase, but we reconstructed it in firestore as we ran in to problems with implementation realized later. 
In the revamp process I mainly redid all the login page in terms of firestore syntax and I left profile setup for another sprint.
After review a lot of the code and Ui and made minor changes to code and UI.

### Paul Cochran

For this sprint, I designed the original version of the app's logo, uploaded the initial app's framework to GitHub, researched and linked Google Cloud Firestore into our app, wrote the majority of the registration activity, and figured out the integration of Firestore. 
We encountered SO MANY ISSUES WITH ANDROID STUDIO. 
It crashes constantly when we test things on the emulator and won't even load on my computer after today. 
Other than that, figuring out Firestore was very difficult and sadly hindered a lot of things on this sprint. 
For our goals next sprint, we should definitely start earlier in order to have an easier pace and reduce frustrations (but I would chalk that up to Spring Break honestly).
Overall, I'm super proud of what the team accomplished despite all of the glitches and can't wait to see what we can accomplish once everyone's SDKs are reinstalled :)
