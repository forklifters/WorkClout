|            | Brian Zhang | Look for databases and see how they should be structured | Research Firebase to find out generally how to use it or what it's used for | Pick what to focus on for the first sprint | Re-look at firebase and how it works. Then look for sources to help with android studio code | Start looking for code implementation for login-screen | Take a look at how firebase connects with log-in | Continue to look at database and interaction with app | I will finish registration with all functionality needed | Splitting the database into parts | Choose and finish execution on |
|            | Nathan Lieu | Look for a database to use | Research Firebase | Reevaluate determine user stories for sprints | Finalize User Stories to use | Create UI for login screen | Attempt to create login page for app functionality | Modify login screen and complete possibly |  Finish login Screen and link with database while checking if widget intents move you to correct pages | Make minor edits to current registration and login, also review any missed details | Finish profile setup page | Finish profile setup page |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Benjamin Napier | My AVD in Android Studio is currently broken and I'm not sure why | I still haven't managed to figure out exactly what is broken for my emulator. I'm planning to reinstall a new virtual device and do some updates to Android Studio. Hopefully something works. | No | No | I'm not sure exactly what the team wants to go on the registration screen because it is not a user story we accounted for earlier. I need to communicate with the team more about that at tomorrow's meeting | Team has decided to start over on firebase things (I don't really understand because I haven't been involved with that aspect of the project) so I have to wait to upload my files. | Figuring out linking database with registration | I am a bit stuck on how to actually get the app logo to actually show up. I will try following some more tutorials to get it working. | No | Having difficulty compiling my unit tests. Need registration/homescreen activities to be updated before tests can be made. |
|            | Paul Cochran | Not really... | Nope. | Getting in touch with the rest of the team | Nope! Shout out to my team. | Lack of github knowledge | Nah. I understand Github a little better now | Nope! Github is a lil crazy | I don't have an eye for graphic design | A lot of time commitments tomorrow :/ | Nope |
|            | Brian Zhang | No | Translating what I've learned to a practical app | It hard re-evaluating what you've already decided, it requires co-operation with others | No | No | Android studio is not cooperative | Firebase is really hard | There are some errors that I don't know how to fix and am working through them | No | Not fully sure on how to implement things |
|            | Nathan Lieu |  Add Android studio plug-in | Deciding which database | Communication not everyone able to talk at same time | No |  No | No | No | Some errors and github usage | Had a few issues pushing to github | Understanding of firebase commands | Understanding of firebase commands |
| What insights have you made? | Benjamin Napier | Android Studio is hard to learn... |  I've learned some things about using Google Drive to manage this project and figured out how to link my Android Studio with my Github account |  Updating Android Studio and using an AVD that was running 8.0 instead of 9.0 fixed my issue with the AVD not running apps properly | Register will need to be created ~first to make fully functional tests for the home page/login screen | The registration screen will need to have a seperate page that will force users to input required information for a user account in order to prevent several users that lack age/weight/etc. information |  I need to do some research into making UIs for Android because the things I make are quite ugly |  Dealing with constraint layouts in Android | One of our user stories was a duplicate and must be fixed. Implementing the logo to the app was harder than I think it should be. | Adding the logo was far easier than I expected I was just trying to follow the wrong tutorial. I found a 5 minute YouTube video that taught me all I needed to know today | Constraint Layout in Android Studio is more efficient and easier to code but the tutorial I followed used Relative Layout and I understood relative layouts so I will probably continue using it even though I don't think it is technically the best method. |
|            | Paul Cochran | Graphic design is not my passion |  Not really. |  I would love to do the database part of the app. It seems fun | I don't understand Git as well as I should haha | A little fuzzy on some of the requirements | Starting to actually figure some of this out. Less frustrating than before. | I'm back to being frustrated with Github | I've been referring to the database software as "Firestone" and it's most definitely "FireSTORE." Big oof I promise I can read. | Firestore account integration only works for one google account/user at a time. | None |
|            | Brian Zhang | Nothing in particular yet | How our database should be structures or what we have to keep in mind |  We should prioritize user stories that are simple and are important to the entire app working or functioning normally | None |  None | I need to look more into firebase implementation | None | Overall, I think things will be fairly smooth sailing once we get through this initial hump, the beginning parts of what we want to do are fairly easy | None | None |
|            | Nathan Lieu | Android Studio is cool |  None | We need to take time on planning and meet the requirements agile |  None | I need to learn android studio coding |  You must keep track of all the intents and movement along UI | None | None | Understanding of how firebase works with android |  None |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Benjamin Napier | Not yet! |  Team needs to get on board with using Google Drive to communicate about what we are doing and what needs to be done next. | No |  I will need to create Register user story first | A different registration screen needs to be made that was not originally planned | No |  No | A new user story must be created to replace the duplicated user story | No | Future UI updates to standardize the app appearance. | No |
|            | Paul Cochran | Nope! Just adding the logo to the app once the UI is ready |  Not yet. |  No. |  Files may need to be implemented. |  Once on Git, the files will need to be updated on the repo to include FireStone. |  Nope. |  Nope! Just keeping things up to date on github | Nope! | People should log out and delete their google.json files before pushing to github in order to avoid breaking the vcs | None |
|            | Brian Zhang | Nothing yet |  Nothing | No |  No | No |  There needs to be intent from pages, so a registration page must be created |  Changes to initial code to allow us to work | Pushed a version, not fully working | No | None |
|            | Nathan Lieu | No |  No |  Planning takes time and we will most likely pick different user stories |  Finding User Story |  My ability in android studio | No | No | Need to push and pull versions to get complete login and registration when done | No | Possible revisions of setup ui | Possible revisions of setup ui |
