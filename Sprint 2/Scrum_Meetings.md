| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Benjamin Napier |   Made placeholder UI for Homepage and forgot password functions | Fixed broken things that were making app crash, testing app on actual Android phone, and adding more UI functionality | Worked on the UI for homepage | Got hit by a car | Got hit by a car | More work on the UI for homepage and linking to other UI pages |
|            | Paul Cochran |  Brainstormed ideas for fixing the login corruption with the database and watched videos about navigation drawer layouts in android studio for the homescreen  |  Developed and implemented a hashing method for creating a unique and replicable userID for the database login and registration system and fixed the login activity  |
|            | Brian Zhang |  Brainstormed primary keys for ID checkout and looked into current implementation removing/fixing things | Started work on homepage, further work on navigation drawer
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Benjamin Napier | Test app on real Android phone and add more UI functionality | Work on getting Login screen to work properly | Continue working on the UI for homepage | Fix my back | Get my stuff together to get working again | Get the UI linking to pages done |
|            | Paul Cochran |   Try to come up with some way to create unique ID's for each user in the database that can also be referenced later  |  Begin working on the rest of the app's activities and features (like challenges and leaderboards  |
|            | Brian Zhang |   Ill start work on homepage | Finish homepage and create intent to other pages
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Benjamin Napier | Database is not working properly, making it difficult to continue UI work | Database still not working correctly and other team members keep changing small things in the XML that I have to go back and fix | Had to throw out old UI for homepage because it was causing bugs | I got hit by a car | I got hit by a car | None |
|            | Paul Cochran |   My android studio still won't run the emulator  |  I learned that the emulator problem was caused by Avast Antivirus and corrected the issue now, but it took me awhile  |
|            | Brian Zhang |  Figuring out what was wrong with emulator and what was breaking code | Nothing yet
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What insights have you made? | Benjamin Napier | Using the relative layouts overlapped in one xml file makes working on UI difficult because you cannot see changes being made | I need to add more documentation to each XML file to help other team members find id names for creating functions from buttons and other UI elements | Using the premade homepage activity from Android Studio is the way to go | Honda makes cars that hurt | Honda makes cars that hurt | Linking the homepage is complicated because the app keeps crashing when I try to switch activities |
|            | Paul Cochran |   Our database is not set up like it needs to be  |  Our database works for what we need now, but might be a pain later for searching and getting things for leaderboards  |
|            | Brian Zhang |   There are multiple ways to fix/do certain things - would like to avoid complex code | Our database might run into problems later on
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Benjamin Napier | During this sprint I will have to change the XML for the login screen because it is confusing the team members who are working on the database | Documentation on each XML file needs to be created sooner rather than later | Homepage must be redone | No | No | No |
|            | Paul Cochran |   Not yet  |  The login screen needed to be changed, but it has already been fixed by Nathan and me |
|            | Brian Zhang |  Others are waiting on revert commit | None
|            | Nathan Lieu |
