| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Benjamin Napier | Implemented recyclerview into challenges layout | Homepage UI changes | Separated which UI page the app takes a user to for challenges according to whether they are a coach or athelete | Added verification activity UI | UI changes in settings, profile setup, and verify | Added create teams UI and separated the UI for teams and create teams between coaches and atheletes | Added clout score to HomePage and for use in leaderboard | Fixed app crashes caused by verify and challenges activities | Added difficulty and length of challenge to challenge views | Added nested scrollview to HomePage to display active challenges and progress |
|            | Paul Cochran |   Messed around with recycler view, but was unsuccessful  |  Looked into ways to retrieve and search through the database  |  Tried to use DocumentReferences through Firestore to search for random documents in the database  |  Realized that this method would not work and worked on getting the original code back |  Researched other methods of interacting with the database, found Queries and experimented  |  Watched several videos on queries and tried to code them, but none worked  |  Finally got queries to work  |  Used queries to finish getting the challenges into the recycler view that Ben made |  Implemented functionality of signing up for a challenge |  Linked the database to the users for signing up for a challenge  |  Created Leaderboards UI  |  Worked at writing the code for the Leaderboards |  Ran into strange issues with the leaderboard queries and my emulator started crashing again :/ |
|            | Brian Zhang |   Failed to properly send email using Java Mail API | Java Mail API .jar files added, email still does not send | Composed email through intent - it only composes email, but it is a workaround way to verifying | Verifying email works but is definitely not perfect. I started talking to Nathan about how to structure teams | Started creating teams collection | Made it so that players can be added | The create teams now has some form of error handling | Used query to get data from athletes | Cleaned up some code from previous sections and worked on documentation | Finished documentation
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   Research more firestore methods of accessing data  |  Implement DocumentReferences for challenge signup  |  Fix everything I broke XD  |  Investigate Queries further  |  Try to implement query code  |  Keep trying queries because we desparately need them for everything  |  Add queried data into the challenge page   |  Work at challenge sign-up  |  Start working on leaderboards  |  Code the queries for leaderboards  |  Hopefully fix everything I broke and push before the meeting with the TA |
|            | Brian Zhang |   Hopefully get the email to send properly | Send the email, or figure a different way of verifying | Randomly generate code for user to input | Start creating teams from coaches | Have it so the coach can properly add athletes to the team | Error handle the coach adding athletes | Make it so the teams is connected to other parts of the program - The leaderboard depends on team | There are pieces of code that need to be reformatted to fit in with how we currently do things | Work on some of the documentation and help the others when needed | Finish documentation

| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |  Emulator is terrible  |  Nothing new  |  (Emulator actually fixed)  |  DocumentReferences are weird and I don't understand them yet  |  Document References don't work  |  I don't get queries yet  |  Nope  |  Nothing new  |  App is crashing again  |  Nope  |  Nothing new again  |  Emulator is being wonky again  |  Queries broken for leaderboards  |  Emulator doesn't work now |
|            | Brian Zhang |   I cannot sync/instatiate the .jar files properly for whatever reason | I have the .jar files in the classpath but the imports are still not working | Nothing yet | None | Not sure on how to add the specific amount of athletes to a team | Don't know how to link athletes with teams | Don't know how to verify an athlete is an actual athelete | Need to learn query stuff | None | Nothing
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What insights have you made? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   I'm gonna be a math major woah  |  No one else knows database stuff so if I can't figure this out then we're doomed  | My emulator is working again  |  This is harder than I thought  |  Oh no  | Okay queries could work well  |  Queries are deceptively hard  |  I wish I had learned more UI throughout the semester   |  Figured out queries (aka we're saved) |   whatever job I get in comsci need to be in the backend, not frontend  |  Leaderboards could be easier if we structure it by top 10 or something  |  Queries can be used in ascending or descending order to solve this  |
|            | Brian Zhang |   I need to add things to the classpath | Potentially figure out a different way to do this | None yet | It is not the most secure verifying but it works | We should work together to determine how to format db could run into problems later | The way it set up currently, create teams cannot verify | None | Queries are very important for all of the remaining stuff we need to do | None | None
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   Ben might have to fix some recycler view things  |  Nope  |  Nope |  Nope  |  Database might need to be restructured a bit  |  Nope  |  Nope  |  Naming within the database for Team Names  |  Naming of a few more variables  |  UI changes  |  Refactor clout to a number, not a string  |  Help from Ben with some UI possibly?  |
|            | Brian Zhang |   Nothing yet | None | Benjamin usually creates UI/pages when we need them, will have him create a verify page for me | The database could potentially need a bool value for if they are verified or not | None | Nothing yet | Paul needs information from the teams to create leaderboard properly | Nothing | Nope | No
