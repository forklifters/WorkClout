| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Benjamin Napier | Implemented recyclerview into challenges layout | Homepage UI changes | Separated which UI page the app takes a user to for challenges according to whether they are a coach or athelete | Added verification activity UI | UI changes in settings, profile setup, and verify | Added create teams UI and separated the UI for teams and create teams between coaches and atheletes | Added clout score to HomePage and for use in leaderboard | Fixed app crashes caused by verify and challenges activities | Added difficulty and length of challenge to challenge views | Added nested scrollview to HomePage to display active challenges and progress |
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Failed to properly send email using Java Mail API | Java Mail API .jar files added, email still does not send | Composed email through intent - it only composes email, but it is a workaround way to verifying | Verifying email works but is definitely not perfect. I started talking to Nathan about how to structure teams | Started creating teams collection | Made it so that players can be added | The create teams now has some form of error handling | Used query to get data from athletes | Cleaned up some code from previous sections and worked on documentation | Finished documentation
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Benjamin Napier | Make changes to the HomePage UI | Separate the UI page the app takes a user to for challenges and create challenges activities | Add the UI for verification screen | Update UI for several pages with some of the new UI things I have learned | Make the create teams UI and separate the UI for create teams and teams | Add clout scores | Add difficulty and length to challenge displays | add difficulty and length to challenge displays since I had issues with crashes in the app last time | Fix HomePage to display things better | N/A |
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Hopefully get the email to send properly | Send the email, or figure a different way of verifying | Randomly generate code for user to input | Start creating teams from coaches | Have it so the coach can properly add athletes to the team | Error handle the coach adding athletes | Make it so the teams is connected to other parts of the program - The leaderboard depends on team | There are pieces of code that need to be reformatted to fit in with how we currently do things | Work on some of the documentation and help the others when needed | Finish documentation
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Benjamin Napier | Database things are not correct for me to add everything I want to the UI | No | Waiting on backend for verification to figure out what they need for the UI | No | No | I have to learn how to do some database things because our database people are very busy | No | App crashes caused by a bad commit at some point must be debugged |
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   I cannot sync/instatiate the .jar files properly for whatever reason | I have the .jar files in the classpath but the imports are still not working | Nothing yet | None | Not sure on how to add the specific amount of athletes to a team | Don't know how to link athletes with teams | Don't know how to verify an athlete is an actual athelete | Need to learn query stuff | None | Nothing
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What insights have you made? | Benjamin Napier | I learned how to use recyclerview by watching a YouTube tutorial | None really I had to grind on UI changes | I figured out a good way to separate UI according to the type of user logged in which allows for different versions of the app for coaches and atheletes | None, I had to just make some necessary UI today | There are some weird cases where using the navbar like our app does can cause the content of the UI to shift in an unexpected manner | I again had to do many repetitive UI things so no real insights today | I figured out how to use FireStore better by adding fields that did not previously exist | The android manifests will cause the app to crash if not all activities are properly named and included | In our database all numbers are stored as doubles | I figured out how to use nested scrollviews and progress bars |
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   I need to add things to the classpath | Potentially figure out a different way to do this | None yet | It is not the most secure verifying but it works | We should work together to determine how to format db could run into problems later | The way it set up currently, create teams cannot verify | None | Queries are very important for all of the remaining stuff we need to do | None | None
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Nothing yet | None | Benjamin usually creates UI/pages when we need them, will have him create a verify page for me | The database could potentially need a bool value for if they are verified or not | None | Nothing yet | Paul needs information from the teams to create leaderboard properly | Nothing | Nope | No
