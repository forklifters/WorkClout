| What did you complete since the last meeting? | Benjamin Napier |   
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Failed to properly send email using Java Mail API | Java Mail API .jar files added, email still does not send | Composed email through intent - it only composes email, but it is a workaround way to verifying | Verifying email works but is definitely not perfect. I started talking to Nathan about how to structure teams | Started creating teams collection | Made it so that players can be added | The create teams now has some form of error handling | Used query to get data from athletes | Cleaned up some code from previous sections and worked on documentation | Finished documentation
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Hopefully get the email to send properly | Send the email, or figure a different way of verifying | Randomly generate code for user to input | Start creating teams from coaches | Have it so the coach can properly add athletes to the team | Error handle the coach adding athletes | Make it so the teams is connected to other parts of the program - The leaderboard depends on team | There are pieces of code that need to be reformatted to fit in with how we currently do things | Work on some of the documentation and help the others when needed | Finish documentation

| Do you have anything that's getting in the way of doing your work? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   I cannot sync/instatiate the .jar files properly for whatever reason | I have the .jar files in the classpath but the imports are still not working | Nothing yet | None | Not sure on how to add the specific amount of athletes to a team | Don't know how to link athletes with teams | Don't know how to verify an athlete is an actual athelete | Need to learn query stuff | None | Nothing

| What insights have you made? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   I need to add things to the classpath | Potentially figure out a different way to do this | None yet | It is not the most secure verifying but it works | We should work together to determine how to format db could run into problems later | The way it set up currently, create teams cannot verify | None | Queries are very important for all of the remaining stuff we need to do | None | None
|            | Nathan Lieu |
| Do any changes to the project need to be made as a result of your work? | Benjamin Napier | 
|            | Paul Cochran |   
|            | Brian Zhang |   Nothing yet | None | Benjamin usually creates UI/pages when we need them, will have him create a verify page for me | The database could potentially need a bool value for if they are verified or not | None | Nothing yet | Paul needs information from the teams to create leaderboard properly | Nothing | Nope | No
