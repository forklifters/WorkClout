As this is the final sprint, we prioritized the functionality of the app. This meant making sure all of the base requirements were available and working. Ben worked on the UI of the homepage for the first part of the sprint. This allowed for all the pages to be connected. He also created all of the other pages that needed to be worked on making it easier for the other members to focus on writing the functionality of the page. For the later half of the sprint, Ben made challenges display as well as allowed the users to complete challenges and gain “clout”. Brian for the first half of the split finished email verification. Afterwards, Brian worked on the create team page for the coach. Nathan made it so that the settings would stay after the app was closed. He then worked on the coach being able to create a team. Paul created the challenges page and allowed for information to be added. Paul later figured out how queries worked which allowed him to get information form the teams and athletes to create the leaderboards. This also allowed Nathan and Brian to add the emails to the teams. At the end of the sprint we managed to create a working product that has most of the deliverables we set out for. There could be some parts of it that could be refined and it does lack certains things, but it has everything that was specified by the client.
