**Setting up 8AM notifications**

When an account is in the settings page, the user has the option to switch on notifications. When they switch the notification on, they will be continuously notified at 8 AM to do their challenges. Following SOA protocols, the notification switch does not change any of the other settings app. It also does not affect the information stored for the user. This setting must be changed specifically from the settings page as this is the only way to access this setting. It has a discrete unit of functionality that is to have the setting send notifications and continue to unless otherwise specified. 

**Verifying email address (Athlete/Coach)**

When an account is first registering, they will be sent to a verify page. This page has a place for user entry as well as two buttons. One of the buttons labeled "Send code" will allow the user to log in to an email account. When they do so, they will have a composed email that has a verification code. The user then can copy the verification code and put it in the user input section. They will then click the next button which is the verify button. If the code matches, the user will be verified and sent to the profile page in the app. The user will not be permitted if the code is not correct, and there is no way to generate the code without the email address. The only functionality of the page is to verify the account. 

**Joining a challenge (Athlete)**

When in the challenges page, there will be displayed multiple challenges that you can scroll through. You can then choose to join one of these challenges to join. When you join it you will be added to the challenge in the database and you will be able to complete and view the challenge in its entirety. Direct access to the database is not allowed, so users may not enter challenges manually. Information about the challenge is only shown to the athlete through the challenges page. The only form of functionality that is allows is entering in the user into the challenges database. 

**Creating a team framework (Coach)**

If you are a coach on the team page you have the ability to create a new team. This page has three fields for the user to fill out that specify the name of the team, the users that are to be added (emails), and the size of the team. Once the coach fills out the entry forms, they can then click a create button and team will appear in the database. The coach has no access to the database and must fill out the create team page for a team to be created. It is a discrete unit of functionality as the page only has the ability to create a team. 

**Finishing a challenge (Athlete)**

Athletes can view challenges that they are currently signed up for. When they view the challenges they can then click a button that finishes a part of the challenge (depends on how the challenge is split up). There progress is shown in a progress bar, and when a challenge is finished, the athlete will gain clout points. The only way to finish a challenge is through this process of clicking the button. There is no other way to "finish a challenge." The only form of functionality is to display how much of a challenge is finished and to distribute points when the challenge is finished. 

**Checking the team leaderboard (Athlete/Coach)**

When in the leaderboard page the user can show the team leaderboard. When doing so, the user can see the current “clout” (A number that displays how many points from challenges completed a user has) score of themselves and the other users that are in their team. The page will display a ranking in descending order the scores of all the individuals in a team. Following SOA protocols, the user has no ability to change any of the values for themselves or any other user that is shown in the page. Additionally, the page only has the ability to display the scores of the user and their team. 

**Checking the individual leaderboard (Athlete/Coach)**

When in the leaderboard page the user can show the individual leaderboard. When doing so, the user can see the current “clout” score of themselves and where they rank in terms of all of the cumulative “clout” they have gained. The page will display a ranking of the individual’s cumulative “clout” alongside other users. following SOA protocols, the user has no ability to change any of the values for themselves or any other user that is shown in the page. Additionally, the page only has the ability to display the cumulative scores and where the individual user ranks among them.
